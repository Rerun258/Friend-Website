        info
Site plan for a podcast website for me and my friends. 
Each page will have a small section describing who we are and what we are like. (nothing too personal and some information will be fake. Such as birthdays and such and fake ssn for a laugh)
There is a lot of things in this world, here we are talking about our lives and what we do. We will talk and post vidieos about the things going on In our lives and the crazy things that people wish they could do. We will talk about anything crazy enough and take suggestions as long as we can stay within the law (this is on the internet and we donâ€™t want to be arrested)
